# Programming_For_DA_Project2
by Megan Tully

This repository contains four files and a folder. There is a .gitignore file to stop unnecessary files being uploaded, a folder called image which contains the images used in the project, the main file which is a jupyter notebook called Programming_For_DA_Project2, a csv file that contains the dataset downloaded and used in the main file called breast-cancer-wisconsin and lastly this README file with some information on the repository.

This repository was created for my second project in Programming For Data Analysis. The aim of the project was to investigate the Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset.


# Programming-For-DA-Project2 Jupyter Notebook File

## How to run this file (.ipynb)

1. Download both the dataset and the main jupyter notebook file from this repository to your local machine.
2. Open up your command line, I used CMDer which can be found [here](https://cmder.app/).
3. Navigate to the folder where you downloaded the above files.
4. Type "jupyter notebook" into the terminal and it should open up jupyter notebook in your browser with these files in it.

<b>Note</b>: You need to have jupyter notebook installed on your machine. I have [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) downloaded which contains jupyter notebook. You also need a recent version of [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) on your local machine.

You can also use [Visual Studio](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) code to run this file by opening the folder containing the downloaded files inside the application.

### Required Packages (linked to user guides):
1. [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/index.html#user-guide) 
2. [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/stable/users/index.html)
3. [seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/tutorial.html)
4. [numpy](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/)
5. [fitter](https://fitter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
6. [scikit](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)

## Project Summary

This project is split up into six main sections.

<b>1.The Dataset Overview</b>: The aim of this section is to undertake an analysis/review of the dataset and present an overview and background. This section describes where the dataset came from, what it contains and how it was retrieved.

<b>2.Literature Review On Machine Learning Classifiers</b>: The aim of this section is to provide a literature review on classifiers which have been applied to the dataset. The classifiers I discussed in this section were the Decision Tree Classifier (J48),Naïve Bayes,Multilayer Perceptron,K-Nearest Neighbor(KNN) and Support Vector Machine(SVM).

<b>3.Statistical Analysis Of The Dataset</b>: The aim of this section is to present a statistical analysis of the dataset. The dataset was broken down and explored using exploratory analysis.

<b>4.Machine Learning Algorithms</b>: The aim of this section is to use a range of machine learning algorithms, train a set of classifiers on the dataset and present classification performance results. The three models I trained and tested were KNN, Naïve Bayes and SVM.

<b>5.Evaluation Of Results</b>: The aim of this section is to compare, contrast and critique my results with reference to the literature.

<b>5.Evaluation Of Results</b>: The aim of this section is to discuss and investigate how the dataset could be extended by using data synthesis of new tumour datapoints. I discussed three possible methods to synthesise our data.
